###### Modem Design

Telecommunications is an inevitable part of todayâ€™s world. 
The technologies lying behind communication systems and the techniques used varies from system to system. 
This report presents a project that is intended to demonstrate a simple communication system between two computers. 
It is designed to be a proof-of-concept, therefore, improvements on the project like using phase locked loops, 
timing synchronizers and many other communication system components are disregarded. 
Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying (DBPSK) modulation technique is used as the modulation technique and 
it is implemented on two separate FPGAs, one for the transmitter and another one for the receiver. 
Also, communication between the FPGAs is carried out wirelessly by using RF frequencies. 
In order to use RF frequency communication, the project also consists of two separate analog parts, 
one for up converting frequency and another one for down shifting the frequency.
